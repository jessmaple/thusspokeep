            Yeah now I’m fanning out
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside yes I’m airing out, I’m clear of doubt
            <br>
            <br>
            Up in my thoughts so many years I had to sterile out
            <br>
            <br>
            The dearest cloud kept me from here & out
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m here without
            <br>
            <br>
            I tear but how? I thought I cleared it out
            <br>
            <br>
            I guess emotion like the motion get to feel it out
            <br>
            <br>
            You never truly let it go, you got to steer it out
            <br>
            <br>
            Just turn the wheel & you might just cheer cause son it’s there it’s out
            <br>
            <br>
            Your sunshine on the road, just feel the route
            <br>
            <br>
            My mouth, my doubt, my mind my shackle
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m my own drought
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m my own demon
            <br>
            <br>
            My own leech
            <br>
            <br>
            My own reason (you know?) (2x)
            <br>
            <br>
            Feel the season (yeah)

            <br>
            <br>
            No need to doubt it, aye
            <br>
            <br>
            We steady picking up slack, pushing for better days
            <br>
            <br>
            This be the one for the soul, nigga we getting paid
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            This just a common trade
            <br>
            <br>
            Eye for eye, ain’t gotta lie
            <br>
            <br>
            The fuck could I say?
            <br>
            <br>
            I prolly lost my grip with shit when time threw shade
            <br>
            <br>
            Niggas waited long enough
            <br>
            <br>
            Outta reach of excuses, my senses victim of my bluff
            <br>
            <br>
            Condescending niggas flinching up a fuss Outta touch
            <br>
            <br>
            Mental real slow, wonder why they wanna rush
            <br>
            <br>
            I just knew the hurt coming from the jump
            <br>
            <br>
            Disappointing assumption
            <br>
            <br>
            On some spottie ottie bumping
            <br>
            <br>
            Guess the talk was incumbent
            <br>
            <br>
            Shoddy function all i see
            <br>
            <br>
            Stigma fronting for something
            <br>
            <br>
            Copping pleas for your soul
            <br>
            <br>
            Now respect mean nothing
            <br>
            <br>
            I shake my head because that luck just turn hightail running
            <br>
            <br>
            I never pull no punches
            <br>
            <br>
            My nig you Know how we coming
            <br>
